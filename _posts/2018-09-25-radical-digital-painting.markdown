Many channels on Are.na exhibit sophisticated collections of diagrams, maps, and drawings. I would like to augment those with some political content related to arguably the most violent diagrams that exist in the world today, the borders between nations, in addition to ten theoretical “probes” on digital painting. This is Radical Digital Painting & Political Rock brought directly to your eyes and ears by myself and the refugee organisation and techno rock band GP&PLS, also known as Goodiepal & Pals, whom I am currently touring through Europe with at the moment.

Referenced in the podcast is a generative worksheet inspired by an experiment of the late artist Harold Cohen, in addition to a PayPal address used by GP&PLS for donations, which is sara.paypal@gmail.com. You can access the worksheet here: https://ws1.justanothersystem.org (refresh the page to regenerate). Print and draw on or digitally annotate the PDF by connecting the dots in a meaningful way, and upload the results [here](https://www.are.na/jeffrey-alan-scudder/cohen-connect-jas-generative-worksheet-1)

_Editor's note: Are.na doesn't truly have its own podcast (yet!). This episode was created, produced, and edited entirely by Jeffrey Alan Scudder and the members of Goodiepal & Pals as part of their 2018 [Radical Digital Painting & Political Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSk8M6PzDmQ) tour._
